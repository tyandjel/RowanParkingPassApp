Rowan Parking pass officials will start at the Login screen.  It will redirect to the TableDisplay page to see the list of passes
that need to be accepted or denied.  They will click a pass in said table and be redirected to PassDetails.  This allows the user
to see all details about the specified pass then accept or deny said pass.  An email will be sent automatically  once the pass has been
accepted or denied.  Acceptance will send a parking pass.  Denial will notify that the pass was declined.  There is a logout link on
each page that will end the session and redirect to the login page.
