Import this file in virtual box.
In order to get the ramdisk loaded make sure you are using a x32-bit capable machine.
I suggest changing the network adapter to 'bridged' for easy access to the box from machines on LAN.
The "website root" is '/var/www/', there is a utility page there for manipulating databases and doing other adminstrativce tasks.
The server should have PHP, Python, Apache, OpenSSH and MySQL to name a few.
I've been messing around in it, but not enough to commit yet. This is for everyone to use in case they wanted a quick import.

SEE EMAIL FOR FILE. I THINK ITS TOO BIG FOR GITHUB.
